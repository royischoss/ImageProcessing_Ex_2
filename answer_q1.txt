Question1 - 
The diffrence between the two samples was that change_rate.wav
was high toned but coverage all data, while change_samples.wav
was by tone closer to the original but we lost some of the tones.
The reason for the diffrence is the procces we made on each data.
on change_rate we only said we sampled faster so it playing our
samples faster. while on change_samples we clipped the high frequencies
and shorted the data so we lost some tones but the one we heard were as 
in the original sound.
