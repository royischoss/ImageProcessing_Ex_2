Question2 -
The diffrence between resize_spectrogram wav to resize_vocoder was 
that in resize_spectrogram we have holes meaning we don't the sound
as we expected or there is no sound at all.
in resize_vocoder wav we hear the sounds fully but faster without high pitch.
the reason of the diffrence is the phase of the reconstructed spectogram. we 
didn't change phase in resize_spectrogram so we loose information when the waves
are creating interference. and in resize_vocoder we do get the phase right and 
avoid it.
