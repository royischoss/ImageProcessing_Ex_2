Question2 -
The diffrence between resize_spectrogram wav to resize_vocoder was 
that in resize_spectrogram we have holes meaning we don't the sound
as we expected or there is no sound at all or some of the pitch was high.
in resize_vocoder wav we hear the sounds fully but faster without high pitch.
the reason of the diffrence is the phase of the reconstructed spectogram. we 
didn't change phase in resize_spectrogram so we loose information when the waves
are creating interference or high frenquencis because of the new samples in 
diffrent parts of the signal "wave". 
In resize_vocoder we do get the phase right and avoid it.
